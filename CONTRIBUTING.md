# Contributing
As this is an open source project, we would really appreciate pull 
requests for features or bugfixes.

Please be aware that we also maintain a PLUS Version of this plugin, 
so we need to check all pull request not just if they work with the 
free but also if they work with the PLUS. Because of this we may need
to make changes or even reject your pull requests.

We also may reject pull requests if they add features that we won't want to
support many years, maybe because we think they are too unstable or they could
cause too many problems for users.

Neither the less, we are happy for every pull request or issue we get, 
as they help use evolve this project, even if we change or reject them.
